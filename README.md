  - LMB on x-axis: move mouse in screen's x-direction to move vertex along x-axis
  - LMB on y-axis: move mouse in screen's y-direction to move vertex along y-axis
  - LMB on z-axis: move mouse in screen's x-direction to move vertex along z-axis
  - CTRL + LMB on background: removes the selection again
